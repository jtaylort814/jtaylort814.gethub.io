                <h3>How we met</h3>
                <p>We met online almost two years ago and we really hit it off.  We got to talking and we started to get to know one another and we found that we had a lot in common.  She is very intelligent and speaks three different languages.  She speaks Tagalog, Vasayan, and English.  She has a bachelor's degree from Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology. We even share a similar since of humor (which is incredibly rare for someone to get my jokes). So after a few months of getting to know one another, I decided to take a chance and booked a flight to the Philippines.</p><br>
